# Dynamic Web Development
The top-level repo for DWD class at NYU ITP.  DWD is a class about web development (making websites).  
More details on the class can be found [here](https://itp.nyu.edu/~sve204/dwd_spring2018/).

## Whats Inside?
Over the course of 7 weeks, I worked on iterations of a single website -  [an economics riddle.](http://sandbox.calebfergie.com:8000/). Each week the website was improved in terms of design, functionality, and/or security. Each 'week' folder contains the relevant files for an iteration of the website. More writing about the class can be found on [my blog](http://www.blog.calebfergie.com/category/web-dev/).

### Week 1
  * Created and ran the web page on a simple http server using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Weeks 2 & 3
  * Created an ran the website through an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server 

### Week 4
  * Updated the Express server to an [ejs view](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs)
  * Connected the site to a database using [mongojs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongojs)

### Week 5
  * Updated the design of the website using [bootstraps](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### Weeks 6 & 7 (final_v1)
  * Utilized [cookies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookies-js) to detect repeat visitors
  * Fully linked database to responses
  * Updated mathematical operations (see the [results.js file](https://github.com/calebfergie/dwd-repo/blob/master/final_v1/econRiddle/routes/results.js))
  * Updated content and copy of website

### Target improvements
  * Provide data visualization using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
  * Feed repeat users their previous response
  * Add timestamp data for change-over-time analysis
  * Create backend restrictions on data entry
